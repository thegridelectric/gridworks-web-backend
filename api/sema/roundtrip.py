"""Round-trip harness for this Sema snapshot.

Walks ``samples/`` (one canonical JSON instance per type version) and proves
the emitted runtime can decode its own types: for each sample,

  decode (at its own version) -> re-encode -> deep-equal the sample bytes,

and, for a superseded version, additionally

  decode (old) -> upgrade to latest -> re-encode (must succeed).

A sample's bytes are exactly what the runtime emits over the wire (the build
wrote them via ``from_dict -> to_dict``), so a stable round-trip means the
restricted vocabulary in this snapshot is closed and self-consistent. This is
the check that catches a vocabulary word missing *only* from the restricted
snapshot (the ``atn.bid`` class of bug).

Structural validation is the generated pydantic model itself: ``from_dict``
runs full model validation, so a sample that decodes has satisfied the schema
the model was generated from. No external JSON-Schema validator is required.

Run standalone:  ``python -m api.sema.roundtrip``
Or import and call ``run_roundtrip()`` from your own test.
